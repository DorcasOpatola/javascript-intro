i. Arithmetic Operators
  - Addition: +
  - Subtraction: -
  - Multiplication: *
  - Division: /
  - Modulus: %
  - Increment: ++
  - Decrement: --

ii. Assignment Operators
  - Assignment: =
  - Addition assignment: +=
  - Subtraction assignment: -=
  - Multiplication assignment: *=
  - Division assignment: /=
  - Modulus assignment: %=

iii. Comparison Operators
  - Equal to: ==
  - Not equal to: !=
  - Greater than: >
  - Less than: <
  - Greater than or equal to: >=
  - Less than or equal to: <=

iv. Logical Operators
  - Logical AND: &&
  - Logical OR: ||
  - Logical NOT: !

v. Bitwise Operators
  - Bitwise AND: &
  - Bitwise OR: |
  - Bitwise XOR: ^
  - Bitwise NOT: ~
  - Left shift: <<
  - Right shift: >>

<h4>Question 2: JavaScript Operators in 2 examples<h4>

i. Arithmetic Operators
  - Addition: `let sum = 5 + 3;`
  - Multiplication: `let product = 4 * 2;`

ii. Assignment Operators
  - Assignment: `let x = 5;`
  - Addition assignment: `x += 3;`

iii. Comparison Operators
  - Equal to: `let isEqual = 5 == 5;`
  - Greater than: `let isGreater = 10 > 5;`

iv. Logical Operators
  - Logical AND: `let result = true && false;`
  - Logical OR: `let result = true || false;`

v. Bitwise Operators
  - Bitwise AND: `let result = 5 & 3;`
  - Bitwise XOR: `let result = 5 ^ 3;`

<h4>Question 4: What does this code print?<h4>

```
for (let i = 1; i < 20; i += 7) {
  console.log(i);
}
```

Output:
```
1
8
15
```
